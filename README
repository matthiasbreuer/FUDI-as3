*  FUDI bridge
*
   The FUDI bridge serves as bridge between Flash and Puredata. It serves as
   policy server to allow Flash to connect to TCP Sockets and as Bridge when
   using the netreceive object in Flash since Flash can only connect to server
   not create one.
   
   The policy server always opens at port 843. The FUDI server always opens a
   port at 3001, this will be changed in a later release to allow custom ports.
   
*  Running the FUDI bridge

   - Windows users simply double click the fudi_bridge.jar
   - Mac and Linux users must run the fudi_bridge.jar as root
     There are two ways to do this:
     
     1) Open a terminal and cd to the folder where the fudi_bridge.jar is
        located, then type:
          sudo java -jar fudi.jar
     2) Open a terminal and type (' ' becomes '\ '):
          sudo java -jar /path/to\ the\ folder/fudi.jar
     
     For an OS other than Mac and Ubuntu your root command will probably not
     be sudo.
